## P5: Interactive App with Continuous Intelligence 


### Goal 
The goal of this project is to take this repository: https://github.com/denisecase/cintel-05-cintel  and enhance it by:
- Changing the theme, colors, visuals to be more engaging
- Changing the layout to better show the current deque
- Changing the chart to not flash on each update
- Changing the subject domain from temperatures in Antarctica (so we can add it to our Penguin Dashboards) to an alternate focus using random data appropriate for your chosen domain. 
- Integrating live data and continuous intelligence into your own previous interactive app

### Overview
This repository provides a basic example of continuous intelligence - outputs updated on a regular basis or in real time as information becomes available. I took the provided repository and enhanced it by representing data from another location, changing the theme of the app, and adding a map to show the location referenced. The data presented represents real time temperature data in Lebanon, Missouri.
